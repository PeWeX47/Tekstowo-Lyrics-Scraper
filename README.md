# Tekstowo-Lyrics-Scraper

This repository contains a lyrics scraper application that gathers song lyrics from tekstowo.pl.
The application utilizes *customtkinter* for the graphical interface and interacts with an *SQLite* database. It allows users to search for artists, select specific performers, and scrape song lyrics from the tekstowo.pl website.
